## Remote Control for Home Appliances

You are developing an application for controlling various home appliances with a remote control. The remote control, called RemoteControlFunction, has four methods: powerOn(), powerOff(), pressPlusButton(), and pressMinusButton(). However, the home appliances you want to control, including a TV, an air conditioner, and a speaker, have different control interfaces and methods. You need to implement the Adapter Pattern to make these appliances compatible with the RemoteControlFunction without changing their core logic.
